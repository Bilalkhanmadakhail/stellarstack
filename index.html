                <span>Link Cleaner</span>
                <p>TuringSEO LinkCleaner is the tool that helps you manage your website's links easily. You can use it to replace redirecting links with their final destinations, update links that 404 and 500, and change anchor text in bulk across your website. We have different options for people who want to do everything themselves or those who want to automate things with rules. LinkCleaner is perfect for all your link needs and we even have methods to make updates as frequently as you need them.</p>

                <p>Duplicate content can be a big problem for some websites and while there can be multiple causes, one of the most common is the inconsistent use of SSL, subdomains, mixed case and trailing slashes in internal URLs. Some websites don’t even bother to address this issue. Others use complicated redirect strategies. LinkNormalizer puts the SEO in control. You decide what the URL standard should be and we standardize the URLs on your website.</p>

                <p>What do you call a page that receives no traffic or page views? We call it vanity. 
                   </p><p> Some credible estimates show that more than 90% of all pages available to search engines receive no traffic whatsoever. Nearly another 5% receive less than 10 visits a month. What kind of SEO signal do you think having a website like this sends to Google?  </p><p> 
                    Most website owners spend hours pouring over the performance of pages that receive traffic or page views and virtually none on those that get none. </p><p> 
                    THINMATIC uses your WordPress database, Google Analytics and Google Search Console data to help you identify which pages are not useful to your business. THINMATIC will then move these pages into a new unpublished state (and with Link Cleaner, remove/redirect any inbound links to these pages).</p>
